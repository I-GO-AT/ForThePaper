### Abstract  
> Agriculture has achieved the technological advances using the Internet of Things (IoT) and the power supply for the IoT plays an important role. Nowadays, there has been a tendency to use alternative energy at remote areas. It is important that for farmers to recognize the stable power delivery and residual quantity of power. This paper describes system architecture and software implementation for continuous monitoring the solar panels efficiency. To establish the system, we collected some data including surface temperature of solar panels, degree of power charge and weather information etc. using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), OpenWeatherâ€™s Application Programming Interface (API) and the equipment of a company called Victron Energy. Also, data collected can be easily presented to farmers through web-based GUI, which can make them monitor solar energy efficient.
